DJANGO is a python web-framework.

In the chall we are given a findme.zip, extracting it gives us a find me dir, which is actually a server that can be hosted, with bunch of folders and python file.

The challenge was suppposed to be solved by hosting the server onto the local machine and look for the source code review
But after trying the conventional method, It sort of came to my mind if I have the flag on the server I just need to look for a file
on the directories itslef:

So looking for something I found "index.html" 

PATH ----> /findme/core/templates/core/index.html

SOURCE CODE OF index.html
================================================================================================
<!DOCTYPE html>

        {% ifequal user.username "sudo" %}

    console.log("creating a super user account in django might help you..")

================================================================================================

inside the <body> tag there is some unusual text

{% ifequal user.username "sudo" %}
        	<h1>intr0_t0_djang0</h1>
 {% endifequal %}

intr0_t0_djang0 if the flag we need. 

Flag format : RESTCON{<- flag -<}
